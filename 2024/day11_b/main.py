# As we need much more iterations of blink in part 2, it no longer runs in acceptable time.
# Therefor, instead of "blinking" every stone, we rather create a dictionary with as key the number on the stone
# and as a value the amount of times we have that specific stone.
# This way we can reduce the amount of iterations significantly as we "blink" all stones with the same number at once.
# Amount of total stone iterations with 25 blinks:
# - Part 1: 376683
# - Part 2: 3542
# So as listed above the method used in part 2 has fewer iterations as part 1 and is a lot faster.
